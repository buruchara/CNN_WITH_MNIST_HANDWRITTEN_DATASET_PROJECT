# CNN_WITH_MNIST_HANDWRITTEN_DATASET_PROJECT
#The code performs the following steps:
Imports the required libraries.
Loads the MNIST dataset, which consists of a training set and a test set.
Reshapes the data to match the input shape expected by the CNN model.
Normalizes the pixel values by dividing them by 255.
Defines the CNN model architecture using the Sequential API from TensorFlow.
Compiles the model with the specified loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric.
Fits the model to the training data, specifying the number of epochs.
Evaluates the trained model on the test data to obtain the loss and accuracy metrics.
